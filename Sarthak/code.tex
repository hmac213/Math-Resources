\title{Sarthak Code Problem}

\begin{document}

For a sequence $s = (s_{1}, s_{2}, \dots, s_{n})$, define
\[F(s) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} (-1)^{i + 1}(s_{i} - s_{i + 1})^{2}.\]

Consider the sequence $S = (2^{1}, 2^{2}, \dots, 2^{1000})$. Let $R$ be the sum of all 
$F(m)$ for all non-empty \emph{subsequences} $m$ of $S$. Find the remainder when $R$ is divided by 1000.

\emph{Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by deleting some non-negative number of values without changing the order.}
